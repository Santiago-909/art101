			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p> The challenge was that we had to make sure we didn't have any extra alligator arms.  We found that even if we mistyped something small, it would affect it. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> We found that the problems in this lab had to do with knowing the right order of the commands to put in.  However, once we figured it out, the rest of the lab was straightforward. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I feel that we put in a good amount of effort into this, I am happy with how my page looks.  We worked together, which was very helpful.  </p>
