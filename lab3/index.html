			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem Solving </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to use Pseudocoding to prepare a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in JS.  We had to use critial thinking and our problem solving skills. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> The problems that arose were that we had to really think granullarly about which tasks required subtasks and such.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This was a nice assigment because it helped us think more critically of every day tasks.  I feel that this type of coding is helpful in real life when you have a lot of tasks that you can break down into little ones. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> 
						<P\p>Accept user input </P>
						 <p> Has to be either rock, paper or scissors </p>
						<p>Validate user input  </p>
						 <p> Double check to see what the player chose </p>
						<p> Evaluate possible moves </p>
						 <p> Choose whether opponent will choose rock, paper or scissors </p>
						 <p> Choose move </p>
						 <p> Make selection of input (rock, paper, or scissors) </p>
						 <p> Run win-test of result </p>
						 <p> See what both parties chose </p>
