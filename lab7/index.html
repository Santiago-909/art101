			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Our challenge as a team was to experiment with anon functions in JavaScript and to also experiment with callbacks. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Debugging the console is what was most troubling, since we really had to look for the small details in the code, like ; or ) to make sure that we had all the functions correct. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab went pretty smoothly for my partner and I.  We were able to successfully use the console to play around with anon functions.  We put effort into this and were able to figure it out.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Check console for results! </p>
