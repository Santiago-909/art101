			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Our challenge as a team was to use functions in JavaScript to get a username and then sort that user name using a string array.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>To be honest, doing the example in the lecture and having the template made this so much easier.  I would've been lost without the canvas example to guide me.  However, I still had to proofread to amke sure I correctly inputted every part of the function.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab went really smoothly for my partner and I.  We were able to successfully use the function to make the username sort.  We put a good amount of effort into this and we were successfull.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Here is the function sorting the name you input at the beginning of entering the webpage.</p>
