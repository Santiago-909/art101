			<h1>Lab 2 - HTML and CSS Starter</h1>
			<p>Hello World</p>
			<p>I'm Santiago, I'm a third year Literature major and a porter affilate.  I have a cat that I dearly love and I enjoy listening to music and watching movies/shows.  I have a part time job and I also referee youth and adult soccer.  I have zero experience coding aside from playing video games and using video editing software, but I want to learn!  I'm a hard worker and will carry my weight.  My section is the 7 pm one as well. 
				<p>Hi everyone! My name is Angelina, (she/her) and I'm a second year art major.  I am super into animation and want to pursue that in the future.  I don't have any coding experience but am excited to learn more throughout the quarter.</p>
