					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge was learning how to work with HTML and CSS code to change our webpage.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Our CSS was not udpating correctly and we spent 2 hours trying to make it update our HTML, but it wouldn't work at all.  I had to change mt style inside HTML and not CSS becasue CSS wouldn't work at all.</p>
