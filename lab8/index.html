					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Our challenge as a team was to use JQuery to have buttons that would change the CSS of our page and toggle it on or off. 
					</p>

			<div class="Problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I am turning this in even though the buttons don't work, I have checked the console and it tells me everything is good, but the buttons still won't work.  I suspect this is a case of a CSS indentifier I am missing.  I will submit what I have so far, then go to section, fix this and resubmit.</p>

			<div class="Reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Will do once I fix the problem and resubmit.</p>
